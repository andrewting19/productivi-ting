# Dopamine Detox

A Chrome extension that applies visual filters to distracting websites and blocks video autoplay to help you stay focused.

## Features

- **Visual Filters**: Apply red tint or grayscale filters to distracting sites
- **Video Autoplay Blocking**: Automatically pauses videos on Twitter, YouTube, etc.
- **Video Unlock Challenge**: Solve a math problem to watch any video
- **Configurable Site List**: Add or remove sites from the block list
- **Break System**: Take timed breaks after completing a 3-step focus challenge

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP
2. Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the extension directory

## How It Works

When you visit a blocked site:
1. A visual filter (red or grayscale) is applied to make the page less appealing
2. All video autoplay is blocked
3. Clicking play on any video triggers a math challenge modal
4. Solve the math problem to unlock and watch the video
